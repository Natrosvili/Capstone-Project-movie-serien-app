Determined to prove her worth and join the ranks of the tribe's warriors, Naru, an expert Comanche tracker and healer, hones her combat skills. Constantly in the shadow of her skilled hunter brother Taabe, Naru gets the chance to shine when a brutal mountain lion attack brings to light something far more sinister than the virgin habitat's savage beasts of prey. And after seeing a sign in the morning sky, Naru realises she is ready for the big hunt--her rite of passage. However, does sharp-witted Naru have what it takes to confront the Predator (1987)?",
